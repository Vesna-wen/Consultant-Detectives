        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px; padding-bottom: 30px;text-align:justify;">This year, homicides and nonfatal shootings in Chicago started to decline from recent peaks in 2020 and 2021. Despite these encouraging trends, we must not ease our focus on shootings.The following data visualizations show our full year-end analysis of Chicago shooting trends in 2022.
These numbers represent much more than statistics; they reflect the lives lost, the families grieving, and the communities fighting for safety and justice. At the University of Chicago Crime Lab, we publish these data because understanding the full picture of gun violence is critical to finding solutions. By delving into these trends and inequities, we hope to help policymakers and community leaders develop strategies to support those most affected by gun violence down the road.

          <p style="text-align:justify">The first map displays the distribution of shooting incidents in 2022 using a white-to-red gradient, where darker red indicates a higher concentration of shootings. It highlights areas most affected by gun violence, particularly near downtown Chicago, where the Austin community recorded over 200 incidents. The eastern coastal areas, including SOUTH SHORE and AUBURN GRESHAM, also experienced significant gun violence, each with over 100 cases in 2022. In contrast, northern and southernmost regions, such as HOARE and SOUTH DEERING, reported fewer than 50 incidents.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify">The second map shows the percentage change in shooting incidents between 2021 and 2022. It uses a blue-white-red color gradient, where blue indicates a decrease in shootings, white represents little to no change, and red shows an increase. Overall, most neighborhoods saw a significant decline in shootings in 2022, with areas like DUNNING, LOGAN, and ASHBURN showing reductions of over 50 cases. However, some neighborhoods experienced increases, particularly in the north, such as JEFFERSON PARK and EDGEWATER, which reported over 50 additional cases. In the central-southern regions, BEVERLY and ARCHER HEIGHTS recorded nearly 100 additional cases, while a few areas like ROGERS and LOWER WEST SIDE showed minimal changes.</p>

          <p style="margin-right: -530px">This section lists some of the factors <i>most likely</i> to influence the geographic distribution of shootings. These factors and shootings are highly correlated on the map, but more rigorous conclusions require more in-depth research.</p>

         <h4 style="margin-top: 200px; margin-bottom: -20px">Outdoor Shootings and Commuting</h4> 
        <p style="margin-top: 50px;text-align:justify;">The visualization results show potential relationships between gun violence and certain factors. Outdoor shootings are more concentrated along CTA-L routes, particularly near the Green Line and Blue Line (Forest Park) in central Chicago, the Pink Line, and the Orange, Green, and Red Lines in the southern areas. </p>
          
          <p style="text-align:justify">Outdoor shootings were screened because criminals are more likely to commit crimes near public transport or in open outdoor areas, which are usually densely populated and have more escape routes, giving criminals ease of movement. By focusing on outdoor shootings, it is possible to analyse more accurately the impact of such environmental features on criminal behaviour.</p>

          <h4>Shootings and Abandoned Buildings</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Areas with a higher density of abandoned buildings tend to exhibit a higher concentration of gun violence incidents. Abandoned buildings can serve as locations that facilitate criminal activities by providing cover or acting as spaces that are poorly monitored. These neglected areas often reflect broader socio-economic challenges, creating environments where gun violence is more likely to occur.</p>

          <h4>Shootings and Social Vulnerability Index</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Similarly, regions with higher Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) values also demonstrate a greater prevalence of shootings. The SVI measures factors such as poverty, lack of access to transportation, and crowded housing, all of which can contribute to increased social instability and crime rates. This pattern is particularly pronounced in the midwestern and southern regions, where these socio-economic vulnerabilities intersect, amplifying the risk of gun violence.</p>

   <p style="text-align:justify">This figure presents the chronological evolution of U.S. gun policies from 2019 to 2023, including key legislations such as the 2019 H.R.8 and Bump Stocks Ban, the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the 2023 Protect Illinois Communities Act, along with their context and evaluations. (<i>H.R. xxx indicated that this is the Xth bill introduced in the House</i>) The data indicates a year-by-year decline in gun violence in 2022 and 2023 following policy implementation. It specifically highlights the comparison of gun violence incidents between July–December 2021 and 2022, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in reducing gun violence during high-incident summer months. </p>

        <h3 style="color: #41B6E6; font-size: 20px; margin-top: -10px;margin-bottom: 40px; text-align:justify; margin-top: 20px;">Future to do</h3>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(77, 202, 220, 0.2); border-radius: 10px; padding: 30px;text-align:justify">1, The police can establish an integrated data analysis platform to monitor and analyze crime trends in real time. This system can identify high-crime areas and predict potential crime hotspots, enabling optimized resource allocation. For example, in high-crime zones like Austin and South Shore, patrol frequency can be increased, and rapid response mechanisms can be implemented to enhance safety. Additionally, Chicago police can create an interdepartmental data-sharing network, connecting police, prosecutors, and community services for instant information sharing and collaboration, improving case efficiency and supporting preventive measures.</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(77, 202, 220, 0.2); border-radius: 10px; padding: 30px;text-align:justify">2, Police efforts should focus on the CTA-L routes and problematic areas in the west and south. Adjusting police resource allocation and increasing patrols in these regions could enhance stability. Relevant government departments should promptly address abandoned buildings to prevent them from becoming hotspots for criminal activity. Furthermore, society should pay close attention to areas with high SVI values, providing more public support, fostering economic development, and promoting social equity to tackle the root causes of crime.
</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(77, 202, 220, 0.2); border-radius: 10px; padding: 30px;text-align:justify">3, Building design should also be considered to reduce shooting incidents. First, government departments should develop and update building design codes and include specific guidelines for shooting incidents to provide a safer environment for public Spaces and office Spaces. Secondly, building designers need to optimize building safety design, focusing on the number and layout of exits. Increasing the number of exits can improve the success rate of personnel evacuation and reduce the occurrence of injuries. At the same time, make sure that exits near potentially hazardous areas (such as entrances or high risk points) are clear for quick evacuation.
</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(77, 202, 220, 0.2); border-radius: 10px; padding: 30px;text-align:justify">4, Expanding background checks to include all firearm transactions, integrating state and local records into the NICS, and allocating resources for faster processing are essential steps. Enforcing restrictions on assault weapons through regular inspections, a nationwide ban, and incentivized reporting of illegal possession can enhance current legislation. Strengthening federal-state collaboration to combat interstate gun trafficking, expanding violence intervention programs, and scaling up gun buyback initiatives can address root causes. Finally, public education campaigns on firearm safety and the importance of comprehensive gun control can foster community support and drive lasting reform.</p>
